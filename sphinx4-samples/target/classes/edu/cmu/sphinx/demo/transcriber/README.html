      A simple Sphinx-4 application that transcribes a continuous audio file
      that has multiple utterances. The audio file should contain connected
      digits data. The default file, called "10001-90210-01803.wav", contains
      three utterances, separated by silences.
      People who want to transcribe non-digits data should
      modify the <code>config.xml</code> file to use the correct grammar,
      language model, and linguist to do so. Please refer to the 
      <a href="../../../../../../../doc/ProgrammersGuide.html">Programmer's Guide</a>
      on how to modify the configuration file for your purposes.
      </p>

      <h3>Building</h3>
      <p>
      Check if the <code>bin</code> directory already has the
      <code>Transcriber.jar</code> file. If not, type the following in the top
      level directory:
      </p>
      <code>ant -find demo.xml</code>
      <h3>Running</h3>
      <p>
      To run the demo, type:
      </p>
      <code>sphinx4 &gt; java -jar bin/Transcriber.jar</code>
      <p>
      You will see the following result, with each utterance on its own line:
      <pre>
one zero zero zero one
nine oh two one oh
zero one eight zero three
      </pre>
      <p>
      <span style="color: FF0000; "><b>NOTE:</b></span>
      <ol>
      <li>
      Make sure that you are using Java<sup>TM</sup> 2 SDK, Standard Edition, 
      v1.4 or higher.
      </li>
      <li>
      If you have the source distribution, make sure that the JAR file
      <code>lib/sphinx4.jar</code> is built. If not, go to the top level 
      directory and type: <code>ant</code>
      </li>
      <li>
      You can supply your own test files, but they must be digits data.
      Just make sure that the audio format is the same as in the
      config.xml file, which is 16-bit signed PCM-linear, 16kHz, little-endian.
      The audio file format can be any format readable by Java Sound,
      e.g., .wav, .au. To test your own file, supply it as an argument.
      Suppose your test file is called <code>test.wav</code>, then:
      <p><code>java -jar bin/Transcriber.jar test.wav</code>
      </li>
      </ol>
      </p>

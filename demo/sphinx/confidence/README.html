    This is a simple command line program that shows how to obtain confidence
    scores using Sphinx-4. <br>
    <font color="ff0000"><b>NOTE:</b></font> this work on confidence scores
    is still experimental, so please use it with precaution.
    </p>
    <p>
    When you start up the demo program the following will show:

Sample sentences:

the green one right in the middle
the purple one on the lower right side
the closest purple one on the far left side
the only one left on the left

Refer to the file confidence.test for a complete list.

Start speaking. Press Ctrl-C to quit.

&lt;s&gt; &lt;sil&gt; &lt;sil&gt; a purple one on the top right corner &lt;/s&gt;
     (confidence: 0.6045)

     &lt;s&gt;        (confidence: 1)
     &lt;sil&gt;      (confidence: 1)
     &lt;sil&gt;      (confidence: 1)
     a          (confidence: 0.6045)
     purple     (confidence: 1)
     one        (confidence: 1)
     on         (confidence: 1)
     the        (confidence: 1)
     top        (confidence: 1)
     right      (confidence: 1)
     corner     (confidence: 1)
     &lt;/s&gt;       (confidence: 1)

    As you can see, it will show the confidence of the result as a value
    between 0 and 1 (in this case its 0.6045). It will also show the confidence
    of each word in the result. In this case, its all 1's except for the
    word 'a' (0.6045). Note that the confidence of the result is
    computed as a product of the confidence of its constituent words,
    which is why the confidence of the result is 0.6045 in this case.

      <p>
      There is a <a href="confidence.test">test file</a> which contains
      a list of sentences you can say to test the application.
      </p>

      <h3>Building</h3>
      <p>
      Check the <code>bin</code> directory to see if it has the file
      <code>Confidence.jar</code>. If not, type the following at the top level
      directory:
      </p>
      <p>
      <code>ant -find demo.xml</code>
      </p>
      <h3>Running</h3>
      <p>
      First make sure that you have
      <a href="../../../doc/jsapi_setup.html">JSAPI setup</a> correctly. Then,
      To run the demo, type:
      </p>
      <code>sphinx4> java -mx200m -jar bin/Confidence.jar</code>
      <p>
      Use the sentences in the <a href="confidence.test">test file</a>
      to test the demo.
      </p>
      <p><font color="FF0000"><b>NOTE:</b></font> 
      <ol>
      <li>
      Make sure that you give it a large enough heap by putting in "-mx200m".
      </li>
      <li>
      Make sure that you are using Java<sup>TM</sup> 2 SDK, Standard Edition, 
      v1.4 or higher.
      </li>
      <li>
      If you are running Linux and have problems with the audio,
      please read the 
      <a href="../../../doc/Sphinx4-faq.html#microphone_linux">
      Linux JavaSound</a> section.
      </li>
      <li>
      If you have the source distribution, make sure that the JAR file
      <code>lib/sphinx4.jar</code> is built. If not, go to the top level 
      directory and type: <code>ant</code>
      </li>
      </ol>

<pre>      </pre>
<h3>Building</h3>
<p> Check if the <code>bin</code> directory already has the
<code>JSGFDemo.jar</code>
file. If not, type the following in the top level directory: </p>
<code>ant -find demo.xml</code>
<h3>Running</h3>
<p> First make sure that you have <a
 href="../../../doc/jsapi_setup.html">JSAPI setup</a> correctly. Then,
to run the demo, type: </p>
<code>sphinx4&gt; java -mx200m -jar bin/JSGFDemo.jar</code>
<p> <font color="#ff0000"><b>NOTE:</b></font> </p>
<ol>
  <li> Make sure that you give it a large enough heap by putting in
"-mx200m". </li>
  <li> Make sure that you are using Java<sup>TM</sup> 2 SDK, Standard
Edition, v1.4 or higher. </li>
  <li> If you are running Linux and have problems with the audio,
please read the <a href="../../../index.html#demos_faq">Demo
Troubleshooting</a> section. </li>
  <li> If you have the source distribution, make sure that the JAR file
    <code>lib/sphinx4.jar</code> is built. If not, go to the top level
directory and type: <code>ant</code> </li>
</ol>
<p></p>
<p><br>
When the program runs, you will be presented with a series of command
menues that can be spoken. The first menu contains a set of movie
titles that you can 'watch', the second menu contains a set of
newspapers that you can 'read', the third menu contains a set of books
that you can 'read', and finally the last menu contains a set of songs
that you can 'listen' to.  Note that this is just a demonstration of 
the speech technology. This demo will not actually allow you to
'watch' a movie, 'read' a book or 'listen to music'

Here is a sample run.&nbsp; The spoken commands are

<h3>Code Notes</h3>
This demo shows how a JSGFGrammar component can be used  by your
application to select enable different JSGF grammars.  The steps
involved are:

<ul>
<li> <b>Get the JSGFGrammr component.</b> the JSGFDemo constructor
shows how the JSGFGrammar component (called the jsgfGrammarManager in
the demo) can be retrieved from the ConfigurationManager.

<pre>

        URL url = JSGFDemo.class.getResource("jsgf.config.xml");
        ConfigurationManager cm = new ConfigurationManager(url);
        jsgfGrammarManager = (JSGFGrammar) cm.lookup("jsgfGrammar");

</pre>

<li> <b> Use the JSGFGrammar component to load new JSGF Grammars</b> -
The new JSGF gramamrs can be loaded via the <i>loadJSGF</i> method.
An example of how this is done can be found in the 'loadAndRecognize'
method. 

<pre>
     private void loadAndRecognize(String grammarName) throws IOException, GrammarException  {
        jsgfGrammarManager.loadJSGF(grammarName);
        dumpSampleSentences(grammarName);
        recognizeAndReport();
     }

</pre>

<li> <b> Add new rules using a RuleGrammar</b> - a JSGF grammar can be
manipulated directly from Java code. Rules can be added, enabled and
disabled for your application.  The methods 'loadAndRecognizeMusic'
and 'addRule' demonstrate how your application can add new rules.
Here's the 'addRule' method that shows how a new rule can be added to
a ruleGrammar.

<pre>
    private void addRule(RuleGrammar ruleGrammar, String ruleName, 
                String jsgf)   throws GrammarException {
        Rule newRule = ruleGrammar.ruleForJSGF(jsgf);
        ruleGrammar.setRule(ruleName, newRule, true);
        ruleGrammar.setEnabled(ruleName, true);
    }

</pre>
</ul>

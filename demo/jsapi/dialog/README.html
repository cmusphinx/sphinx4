<p> This is a simple command line program that demonstrates how to swap
between multiple JSGF and dictation grammars .<br>
</p>
</font><font face="Arial" size="2">
<p> </p>
<pre>      </pre>
<h3>Building</h3>
<p> Check if the <code>bin</code> directory already has the <code>Dialog.jar</code>
file. If not, type the following in the top level directory: </p>
<code>ant -find demo.xml</code>
<h3>Running</h3>
<p> First make sure that you have <a
 href="../../../doc/jsapi_setup.html">JSAPI setup</a> correctly. Then,
to run the demo, type: </p>
<code>sphinx4&gt; java -mx200m -jar bin/Dialog.jar</code>
<p> <font color="#ff0000"><b>NOTE:</b></font> </p>
<ol>
  <li> Make sure that you give it a large enough heap by putting in
"-mx200m". </li>
  <li> Make sure that you are using Java<sup>TM</sup> 2 SDK, Standard
Edition, v1.4 or higher. </li>
  <li> If you are running Linux and have problems with the audio,
please read the <a href="../../../index.html#demos_faq">Demo
Troubleshooting</a> section. </li>
  <li> If you have the source distribution, make sure that the JAR file
    <code>lib/sphinx4.jar</code> is built. If not, go to the top level
directory and type: <code>ant</code> </li>
</ol>
<p></p>
<p><br>
When the program runs, you will be presented with a menu of commands
that can be spoken. Here is a sample run.&nbsp; The spoken commands are
highlighed in <span style="color: rgb(0, 153, 0);">green.</span>&nbsp;
Note that this is just a demonstration of the speech technology. This
demo will not actually perform the command. Thus, when you say "play
games / play adventure " no game will actually played, similarly, when
you say "make a phone call / call paul" no phone call will be made.<br>
<br>


<p> 
<b>Note</b> - when browsing newspapers from the 'news' menu, this demo
will actually attempt to open the news page in your web browser by
executing the command 'browse web-page-url'.  If you want to enable
this feature place a browse script in your command path.  The script I
use with the firefox browser is this:

<pre>
#!/bin/sh

export FF_HOME="/usr/share/firefox

url="$1"
if [ "x$url" = "x" ]; then
  url="about:blank"
  fi

  if $FF_HOME/mozilla-xremote-client openURL\("$url"\); then
    exit 0
    fi
    exec $FF_HOME/firefox "$url"

</pre>

Here's a sample run:

 Say 'forecast over' when you are done.

Forecast: very windy with strong southerly winds gusting up to fifty or sixty mph
Forecast: misty in the south and southeast with patchy drizzle and risk of fog
Forecast: clear with most places dry and sunny
Forecast: continuing mild with a moderate to fresh southerly breeze
Forecast: forecast over

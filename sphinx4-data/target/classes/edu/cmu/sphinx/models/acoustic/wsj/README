The directories here contain various models trained from
the WSJ data

Features used to train the models were computed from broadband 16 bit
sampled data sampled at 16Khz. The features were 13 dimensional cepstra
computed from 40 mel filters covering the frequency range 130Hz to
6800Hz. The feature type used was 1s_c_d_dd

Contents of this directory are context-dependent acoustic model (mdef,
means, variances, transition_matrices, mixture_weights, noisedict, feat.params)
and a dictionaries (alpha.dict, cmudict.0.6d, digits.dict)

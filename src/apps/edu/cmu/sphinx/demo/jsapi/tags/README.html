      <p>
      These demos provide examples of using the
      edu.cmu.sphinx.tools.tags package to do post-processing
      of RuleParse objects obtained from JSGF grammars.
      </p>
      <p> 
      NOTE that neither one of these demos actually performs
      recognition - they merely show you how to use the action tags
      parsers once you get a recognition result.
      </p>
      <p>
      The first demo, FeatureValueDemo, provides an example of how
      to embed feature/value pair logic into a JSGF grammar using ECMAScript
      and then use the edu.cmu.sphinx.tools.tags.ActionTagsParser
      class to post-process a JSGF RuleParse to get the feature/value
      pairs from a recognition result.
      </p>
      <p>
      The second demo, LiveConnectDemo, provides an example of how
      to embed ECMAScript logic into JSGF grammars that will cause
      objects in your application to be activated when a JSGF
      RuleParse is processed by the
      edu.cmu.sphinx.tools.tags.ObjectTagsParser.
      </p>
 
      <p>
      An example of running the LiveConnectDemo is as follows:
      </p>

      <pre>
sphinx4>java bin/LiveConnectDemo.jar

      <h3>Building</h3>
      <p>
      Check if the <code>bin</code> directory already has the
      <code>LiveConnectDemo.jar</code> and
      <code>FeatureValueDemo.jar</code> files. If not, type the
      following in the top level directory:
      </p>
      <code>ant -find demo.xml</code>
      <h3>Running</h3>
      <p>
      First make sure that you have
      <a href="../../../../../../../../doc/jsapi_setup.html">JSAPI setup</a> correctly.
      Then, to run the demo, type:
      </p>
      <code>sphinx4> java -jar bin/FeatureValueDemo.jar</code>
      <p>or</p>
      <code>sphinx4> java -jar bin/LiveConnectDemo.jar</code>
      <p>
      <span style="color: FF0000; "><b>NOTE:</b></span>
      <ol>
      <li>
      Make sure that you are using Java<sup>TM</sup> 2 SDK, Standard Edition, 
      v1.4 or higher.
      </li>
      <li>
      If you have the source distribution, make sure that the JAR file
      <code>lib/sphinx4.jar</code> is built. If not, go to the top level 
      directory and type: <code>ant</code>
      </li>
      </ol>
      </p>

# This is the main regressionTest script. This script can be run from
# a crontab entry.  The regression test performs the following
# functions:
#
# 	Retreives the S4 source from sourceforge
#	Build S4
#	Executes the tests
#	Generates a summary report and emails it to parties of interest
#	puts the log result back into the sourceforge repository
#
#
# usage: regressionTest [testName]

# S4 code will be checked out here. WARNING: This directory will be 
# completely removed when done

This directory contains the scripts that execute the S4 regression tests.

Here are some simple instructions.


Requirements:

  - Usual set of gnu/unix tools (gawk/perl/cvs/mailx) must be in your path
  - a script called 'scvs' in your path that points to the sourcecode
    repository.  A typical implementation of scvs would look like
    this:

  export CVS_RSH='/usr/dist/exe/ssh' 
  cvs -z3 -d:ext:lamere@cvs.cmusphinx.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/cmusphinx $*

    Since the regression tests access the repository, you will need to setup 
    your public keys properly so that no password is required to checkin or
    checkout. For more details, check
    http://sourceforge.net/docman/display_doc.php?docid=761&group_id=1

 - To add or remove a test from the regression tests, edit the
   'runAllTests' script

 - To add or remove people from the email notification list edit the
   'mailReport' script.

 - whatsNew is a perl script used from the cgi-bin directory on the 
   cmusphinx project shell space. It makes use of a history file, 
   generated automatically. The file creation occurs at sf.net via a cron
   job. The crontab and the script that creates the history file are also
   located in the cgi-bin directory.

 - To setup a nightly regression test, run the script 'regressionTest' 
   from a crontab job. Make sure that paths are setup properly.  Here
   is an example entry:

   0 22 * * * (. $HOME/.profile ; ./regressionTest)

 - Here is the associated profile. Make sure that path is exported


PATH=$PATH:"$HOME/bin:/lab/speech/bin:/usr/dist/exe:/pkg/gnu/bin:/lab/speech/java/j2sdk1.4.0/bin::/lab/speech/bin:/usr/bin:/usr/ucb:/lab/speech/java/j2sdk1.4.0/bin:."
export PATH



There are a number of scripts associated with the regression tests.
Here is a summary of them and what they do.

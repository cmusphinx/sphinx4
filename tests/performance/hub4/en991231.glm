;; Rules to apply to REF and HYP LSN transcriptions

;; training data for the 1996 CSR Hub4 evaluations.
;; Generally speaking, if a certain word occurs
;; in the official training data (which includes
;; the American Heritage Dictionary, AHD) sometimes
;; spelled X and sometimes Y, the difference between
;; X and Y will not be counted an error in the
;; evaluation test.  This forgiveness will not

;;
;; - Jon Fiscus & Bill Fisher, 12/10/96
;;
;; Note - the left hand and right hand sides of
;; many-to-one rules have been interchanged
;; in order to give a finer grain to scoring, even
;; when the single token is in fact the correct version.
;; Because of this, these rules are *not* appropriate
;; to be used to correct transcriptions in general!
;; The original rules which map incorrect versions into
;; correct versions have been kept around as comments
;; when they are materially different.

;; File contractions.rls Version 3 dated 12/13/96
;;
;; Rules to expand contractions in HYP files
;; for the CSR96 Hub4 test evaluation.
;; They are intended to be used on the "lsn" form
;; of transcription, not the "txt" form.
;;
;; Covers contractions found in all CSR96 hub4
;; transcriptions known to NIST as of SOB 12/12/96:
;; training, devtest/ref, devtest/hyp, evaltest/ref,
;; and (evaltest/hyp).
;;
;; NOTE: In the general case, these rules expand
;; contractions into the strings of words that they
;; are legitimate contractions for.  But in the case
;; of "*'s" forms, these rules overgenerate, in that
;; they will expand possessives like "John's hat" as
;; well as contractions.  In order for the possessives
;; not to be counted as errors, the rules for "*'s"
;; also output the original possessive form.
;;
;; The true rules for contraction are a good deal more
;; complicated than represented here.  
;; Whether or not "NP's" is a contraction of "NP has"
;; depends on whether "has" is the main verb, as in
;; "John's a dog" (NO), or an auxiliary/helping verb,
;; as in "John's gone home" (YES).  We are allowing
;; the expansion of "NP's" to "NP has" because the
;; number of cases that this may cause to be erroneously
;; scored (REF form "NP has NP") is smaller than
;; the number of cases that might be erroneously
;; scored if the expansion were not allowed (REF
;; form "NP has PAST_PARTICIPLE").
